# AdaBinaryArrays
Ada Project for COMP 3220 Principles of Programming Languages

This project generates two new datatypes: the BINARY_NUMBER and the BINARY_ARRAY. A BINARY_NUMBER is an integer that can be either 0 or 1 and the BINARY_ARRAY is an array containing sixteen elements of type BINARY_NUMBER. The main method then outputs several examples of the data type being used.
